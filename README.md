# RPiPlayer
Wireless Melody Player for the RaspberryPi.

The goal of this project was to be able to play musical notes off of a Pi connected to a speaker using PWM signalling. The musical notes are sent from a transmitter Pi to a receiving Pi (connected to the speaker) via infrared peripherals. The transmitting Pi acts as a bluetooth server and receives the specific notes to be played from an android app.
